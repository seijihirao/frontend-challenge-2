DieselBank - Frontend Challenge

It's Summer!  A season of fun and heat. Heavy-Rains are very common, but no one likes to go to the beach and be surprised with a storm ðŸ˜¢

As a member of Sweater Weather's Software Engineering team, you were assigned the task to develop the MVP of a brand new forecasting application.

The product team has specified all the user stories needed to be implemented and given you a suggestion for the UI design of the screens. Feel free to explore and create :)

OpenWeatherMaps's API is free and good to fetch forecast data. So you can make use of this API or any other one you like. Here follows the documentation needed to start fetching OpenWeatherMaps's API:

[API - Documentation](https://openweathermap.org/api)

API-key: Just create an account and get a new one.

## User Stories
- I, as an user, need to check the forecast (Current temperature, Min temperature, Max temperature and weather condition) of a specific city by name, so that I could decide to go on a trip, today or on any other day.

- I, as an user, should be informed through error modals or toasts about any problems with my attempt to search for a forecast, so that I can try to fix it before trying again. 

(Examples: City not found, No internet connection and other errors that you consider necessary)

## Objectives:
- Implementing all the user stories would be nice, but keep your focus on the objectives below instead, they're more important to show your development skills.

- The implementation of a global state manager (Redux, context, Bloc, etc.) is mandatory since this is a good practice that helps the code to scale well and be trustworthier.

- You can use React (Web), React Native or Flutter for this challenge. Feel free to modularize your code, choose any design pattern you prefer and use third-party dependencies/UI components if needed.

- Create a Git repository and share with us when you are done.

- Provide instructions to setup and run your project locally in a README file.

- Happy coding! Have fun and show us what you got! :)
